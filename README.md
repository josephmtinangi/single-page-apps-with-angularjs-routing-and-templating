# Single Page App with AngularJS Routing and Templating

## About the app

I am just going to make a simple site with a home, about, and contact page. Angular is built for much more advanced applications than this, but this app will show many of the concepts needed for those larger projects.

# GOALS

- Single page application
- No page refresh on page change
- Different data on each page
